# move-ball
A small HTML animation with balls bouncing around the page

## Description
This project is from the MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN

I was tasked with creating an HTML Div element that displayed a ball on the page to move. Starting code containing the div element and the basic code to make the ball move across the screen was provided.

From there I was tasked with adding edge detection to the code to make the ball reverse direction when it reaches a defined edge. I then was able to get creative and add another ball of a different color. Then I used a bit of math to give each ball a randomly generated direction and velocity. The user can refresh the page and each time each ball will have a different starting direction and speed.

## Installation
The entirety of the code is included in the moveBall.html file. To run the animation, simply open the html file using a web browser.

## Roadmap
In the future I would like to add some functionality to make the animaiton a bit more interactive. Here are some ideas that I would like to implement:

- Implement each dive element using an object so that many balls can be added using a function call for each.
- Add an interface that will allow the user to control aspects of the animation, like how many balls are on the page, and maybe a button to restart the animaiton instead of requiring the user to refresh the page.
- Make each new ball have a random color when it is created.
- Make the boundaries correspond to the window size, so that is the window is resized the boundary is contained in the window.
